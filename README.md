This is a simple plugin that support to quick select text between matched brackets.
This plugin supports `()`, `{}`, `[]`,`""`, `''`, and ``` `` ``` by default. You can customize supported brackets and quotes in settings.

Really hope this plugin can help you!


## Quick start
Just run command `BraSel:Select` or type `alt+a` to select text between brackets. If you wish to select more, just press it again.

If you slected more than you want, at anytime, just press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>U</kbd> (Cursor Undo), you will bring the previous selections back.

If you wish to select text including the brackets, just run `BraSel:Select Include Brackets` or type `cmd+alt+a` on mac and `ctrl+alt+a` on windows.

This plugin also works for **multiple cursors**:
